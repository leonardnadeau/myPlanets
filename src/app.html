Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, it generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core. About 1.4 million kilometers wide, it contains more than 99.8% of the solar system’s total mass.</p>

It has a rocky surface full of craters and experiences extreme temperature variations—from scorching hot in the daytime to freezing cold at night. With virtually no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet.</p>

This dense atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. Its surface pressure is 90 times that of Earth’s, and it rotates backward compared to most planets.</p>
